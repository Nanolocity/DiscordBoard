# DiscordBoard
While running, if you copy a URL of a video from Discord or a picture it lets you download it with just one click(without having to open your browser).
DO NOT FORGET TO READ THE README FILE, IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW THE STEPS CORRECTLY IT WILL NOT WORK.

# How to use

-Turning off
To turn off the application press the logo inside the application window in the top left

-Download
To download a video or image, right click the video or image in Discord and click "Copy link". After that, in the application window the "Download" button will be clickable.
After clicking the button the file will be downloaded to D:\DiscordBoard(if you followed the README file's instructions, otherwise it won't work)

# Source Code
I will release the sourcecode soon for the application(I'll release it after I finish the application)

# Plans

-I'm currently working on the System Tray function so you can just close the application by right clicking the system tray and choosing "close" but until that's done I won't publish the Source Code(also I'm optimising it in the meanwhile)
